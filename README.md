# Slack Bolt App

This is an example App built with [Slack's Bolt Framework](https://slack.dev/bolt-js/tutorial/getting-started) in node.js.

Our App is a simple reactji channeler which reposts messages from any channel the Bot user is part of to a configured channel,
simply by reacting with the âš¡ emoji to any of these messages.

### Features

- Once our App is invited to a channel it will introduce itself with [`member_joined_channel`](https://api.slack.com/events/member_joined_channel) event
- When a user adds a reaction with the âš¡ emoji to a message in a channel where the Bot User is part of, it will post a link of this message to the configured channel.
